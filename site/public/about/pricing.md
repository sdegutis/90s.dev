## Paid apps

App authors will be able to optionally require a fee from users to use their apps.

This feature is not yet ready but is being worked on.

## Promoting apps

Pro accounts can promote apps so that they're shown in the `apps/` drive.

Promoted apps are shown in order of higher tiers first.

Each promotion lasts for one 24 hour period.
