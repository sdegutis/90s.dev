# 90s.dev, a new platform for 90s-dev-themed guest articles

Somewhere around the year 2000, software lost the plot.
Tablets and iPhones came out, dethroning keyboard/mouse UIs.
Aqua and Compiz experiments pushed the limits of the GPU.
Linux and the WWW were destabilizing the UI/UX status quo.
UI frameworks were born and abandoned at an alarming rate.
It seemed that all progress was lost.

But there are a growing number of people who are discontent,
among both software engineers and UI/UX experts and enthusiasts.
Who long for the traditional UIs of Windows or Mac OS, pre XP & X.
Who want to pass the love of the 90s aesthetic on to all posterity.
Who wish for an alternate timeline where the 90s reigned supreme.
Who want to keep pushing the envelope to see what we can make.

So I've decided to repurpose 90s.dev to help us with this dream.
It will feature guest articles from engineers, experts, and enthusiasts,
promoting products, sharing stories and tech, and offering services,
that aim to revive the good ol' days of 90s aesthetic & principles.
Eventually, it will also become a catalog of such software.
