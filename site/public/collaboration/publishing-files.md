# Publishing files

To publish any files on [os.90s.dev](${OSHOST}),
you'll need to [create an account](/creating-an-account.html) first.

After you have created a shared folder:

1. Copy your files into it.

2. Let the community know about it.

3. That's it!

## Using files

Files can be access through the [file system](/understanding-fs.html):

```ts
const logo = await fs.getFile('net/someuser/images/logo.bitmap')
```

And it just works!
