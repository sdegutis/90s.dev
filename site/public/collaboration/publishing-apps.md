# Publishing apps

To publish any files on [os.90s.dev](${OSHOST}),
you'll need to [create an account](/creating-an-account.html) first.

After you have created a shared folder:

1. Copy your app file into it.

2. Let the community know about it.

3. That's it!

## Sharing apps

To get a sharable link to your app:

1. Open your app in [os.90s.dev/#sys/apps/filer.app.js](${OSHOST}/#sys/apps/filer.app.js@net/)

2. Click your app to open it

3. That's it! Your URL is now sharable.

The URL always reflects non-minimized panels,
which means opening your app is enough to
make your URL sharable.

In other words,
if you have other panels open that you don't
want to be part of your shared workflow,
just minimize them, copy your URL,
and restore them.
