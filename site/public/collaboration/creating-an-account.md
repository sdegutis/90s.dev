# Creating an account

The purpose of [os.90s.dev](${OSHOST}) is to be a
collaborative dev environment.

To share apps and libraries you made,
you have to create an account.

Accounts are free, and use OTPs instead of passwords.

With an account, you get one public folder
named <code>[net/](${OSHOST}/#sys/apps/filer.app.js@net/)\<username>/</code>

## Creating an account

1. Create an account in [os.90s.dev/#sys/apps/account.app.js](${OSHOST}/#sys/apps/account.app.js)

2. Login with the token emailed to you

3. Create a folder under [net/](${OSHOST}/#sys/apps/filer.app.js@net/) with your username

Congratulations, you now have a public folder!

You can put anything you want in it: apps, libraries, data files, documentation, etc.

All public files can be accessed via `api.fs`. See [Understanding FS](../guides/filesystem.md#filesystem) to learn more.

## Publishing apps and libraries

Now that you can share code, check out these guides:

* [Publishing apps](publishing-apps.md#publishing-apps)

* [Publishing libraries](publishing-libs.md#publishing-libraries)
