# Publishing libraries

To publish any files on [90s.dev/os/](/os/),
you'll need to [create an account](creating-an-account.md#creating-an-account) first.

After you have created a shared folder:

1. Copy your library files into it.

2. Let the community know about it.

3. That's it!

## Sharing libraries

Libraries are normal code files:

```ts
// FILE: net/someuser/path/to/lib.js

/** Generates random integer from 0 to Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER (inclusive) */
export function randomNumber() {
  return 4 // generated by dice roll
}
```

Libraries can be imported like so:

```ts
import { randomNumber } from '/os/fs/net/someuser/path/to/lib.js'

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log(randomNumber()) // prints three random integers
}
```

And it just works!
