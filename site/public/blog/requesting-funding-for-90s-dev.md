# ~~Requesting funding for 90s.dev~~

~~Hi everyone. A couple months ago I posted 90s.dev under the wrong title.
I called it a video game maker, because that's the *vision* I had for it.
But I posted it prematurely, and it wasn't yet a video game maker.
It was *an retro os web environment*, which I planned to make a game maker *in*.
So a lot of you showed interest, but I asked you to come back later.~~

~~Well, the problem was that I need to be monetized for my efforts on it.
I have practically no spare time due to my state and duties in life.
I *want* to work on it, but I had to focus on making money.
I was able to work on it for 3 months because I burned through *all my savings*.
Plus it's entirely front-end code, which is inherently hard to monetize.~~

~~This is the age old problem of how to fund open source.~~

~~So I had an idea that I thought might be a good solution.
I would use GitHub Sponsors, but as a way to pay me hourly.
Instead of tiers, you would just specify an amount,
and for each $25 that I receive, I would work one hour on 90s.dev.~~

~~Since this would essentially be employment, I should share my resume.~~

  ~~I spent about 3 months on it, working ~14 hours a day, 6-7 days a week[^graphs].
  It was my first time learning about and using most web worker features.
  I had to learn about threads, broadcast channels, message ports, etc.
  (At one point it used a shared worker for the file system but I took it out.)~~
