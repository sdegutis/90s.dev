This guide sets up a dev environment for
apps and libraries in [90s.dev/os/](/os/).


To get a "hello world" sample app working:

1. Extract [helloworld.zip](/os/helloworld.zip) to `helloworld/`

2. Open [90s.dev/os/#sys/apps/filer.app.js](/os/#sys/apps/filer.app.js)

3. Mount `helloworld/app` as `app` and click it

4. Click `helloworld.app.js` (it may take a sec)

5. Open `helloworld` in your favorite IDE

6. Change some text or something

7. Click the app again in `filer.app.js`

Congratulations, your hello world app works!

The entire core and all system apps are included in
the zip. This way you can see how the system works
internally, and even fork and modify built-in apps.
