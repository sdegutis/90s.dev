# Publishing

Sharing apps, libraries, and data is in the works.
Should be ready in a week or so.

In the meantime, you can develop apps locally.
See [Download SDK](download-sdk.md#download-sdk) to learn more.


<!-- 
## Apps

To get a sharable link to your app:

1. Open your app in [90s.dev/os/#sys/apps/filer.app.js](/os/#sys/apps/filer.app.js@net/)

2. Click your app to open it

3. Copy the URL, which is always sharable


## Libraries

All `.js` files can be imported with standard `import` statements & expressions.

```ts
// "net/someuser/path/to/lib.js"
export const randomNumber = () => 4

// "usr/hello-world.js"
import { randomNumber } from '/os/fs/net/someuser/path/to/lib.js'
console.log(randomNumber())
```


## Data files

Data files can be access through the [filesystem](../technical/filesystem.md#filesystem):

```ts
const logo: string = await fs.getFile('net/someuser/images/logo.bitmap')
```
