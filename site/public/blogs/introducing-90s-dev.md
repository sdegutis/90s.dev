# Introducing 90s.dev

My fellow hackers, artists, engineers, musicians, and philosophers,
I am beyond excited to finally share this project with you all!

Behold! [os.90s.dev](${OSHOST}/#sys/apps/editor.app.js)

You should be very confused right now.
Let me explain why this project is so incredibly exciting.
This ain't your grandpa's toy OS!

A while ago I realized I hadn't remade "Warcraft I" like I wanted to
when I first started coding, even though that was about a third
of a century ago. So I started coding.

But before I could finish writing the map maker, I had already created
a development platform *far more interesting* than I meant it to be.

## A new platform

90s.dev is a unique content platform. It's a new way to create
apps, games, art, music, and code libraries, share them with one
another, and collaborate with each other on making these things.

But it does all these in a new, unique way, because it was designed
from the ground up to be collaborative, innovative, inspiring,
have a pixel art aesthetic, and tend towards making games.

### For Hackers

Nothing today quite captures the experience of writing computer code
back when computers were relatively brand new. I wanted to recapture it,
and share it with the whole world.

The 90s.dev platform does exactly that. Every aspect of it is designed
to be a breath of fresh air, from the GUI to the internals, entirely
hackable, and crafted to encourage exploration.

### For Artists

The pixel art aesthetic, though it died around the 2000s sadly,
is once more back in style, and growing every year in popularity,
with projects like Animal Well regularly renewing its beauty.

The gfx behind 90s.dev is specifically designed with pixel art
in mind, optimized to render it efficiently on the slowest devices,
and with visual effects at the heart of the render pipeline.

### For Engineers

Unlike other platforms, 90s.dev is *not* just another throwaway
app by a soulless business. It's a very carefully designed
system, from top to bottom, with attention paid to *every* detail.

We're not just going to throw React.js into it and call it a day.
A core principle of 90s.dev is to see if we can *improve* on our
precedessors, armed with nothing but the benefit of hindsight.

### For Musicians

Audio is at the heart of everything, present but in the background,
subtly influencing the way we experience everything about life,
especially in games. A game without audio is lifeless.

90s.dev is a platform that makes it far easier to make apps for
making music using the new Web Audio APIs, which will enable
the creation of a new music making community!

### For Philosophers

My goals from the beginning have always included creating something
that starts *from scratch*, and rethinks solutions to modern problems
from first principles, to see if we can *do better*.

Limitations always breed creativity. By reducing the platform to a
low-resolution, high-density, pixel-art themed OS inside a web browser,
we have our work cut out for us. *What should it be?*

## A community effort

Whether you're an artist who wants to collaborate on games,
or a developer that wants to make art making apps, 90s.dev
is the perfect place to join forces and make something amazing!

Built from the ground-up specifically for collaboration, 90s.dev
has a built-in public folder that effectively becomes something
like an app store, package manager, and shared file system.

### What can we build together?

There are so many things we can build together!
Just a few that I personally want to make:

* Art: Pixel art paint program
* Art: Sprite editor & animator
* Music: Sound effects editor
* Music: Music editor
* Code: Game code editor
* Code: App code editor
* Code: App GUI builder
* *And so much more!*

## But what *is* it, really?

All of the above was kind of an outline of the principles
that make 90s.dev unique. This is mainly the secret ingredient
behind what enables its innovations. But now to be more concrete:

The app os.90s.dev is a web-based operating system that has:

* An extremely lightweight kernel that can handle 60fps games

* A process manager that uses Web Workers to run all apps

* A highly efficient pixel-art WebGL2-based rendering system

* A shared network that users can publish to and access

* A set of innovative GUI techniques that devs can opt into

* An extremely simple and easy to use Developer SDK

Follow the [hello world tour](../about/hello-world.md#hello-world-tour) to get a sense
of what building an app in 90s.dev is like.

## Why not just use ___?

If you just want to make a game, you're probably better off with Godot.
If you're content with React.js, or if you see nothing wrong with CSS,
then maybe this isn't the platform for you.

The ethos of 90s.dev is to be deeply passionate about beauty and perfection,
to try solving old problems in new ways by thinking far beyond the box, and
to create an environment where creativity, fun, and beauty reign supreme.

## Why is it called 90s.dev?

The idea is to pretend everything technological after 1990 didn't happen.

Here, we reside in a sort of retrofuturistic alternate reality,
where pixel art aesthetics didn't die but only got *prettier* with time;
where HTML and CSS didn't happen; where JavaScript was born an old man;
where React and Vue would have been unnecessary and overcomplicated;
where collaboration was always at the heart and soul of the web.

The driving principle behind 90s.dev is rediscovering beauty in simplicity.
In fact, the entire website you see here was created *from scratch*
to be the most beautiful website code ever written *because* of its simplicity,
both aesthetically and in code. The same is true of [os.90s.dev](${OSHOST}).
