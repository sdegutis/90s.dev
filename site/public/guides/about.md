# What is 90s.dev?

90s.dev is a tiny OS that lives in the browser,
designed from the ground-up to allow developers
to work together to create the best pixel art
game maker the world has ever seen.

The os is primarily accessed through [os.90s.dev](${OSHOST}/),
though it can be embedded too, as it is throughout all the
examples on this site.
