# Who is it for?

The architecture of [90s.dev/os/](/os/) makes it an ideal game development platform:

* **Game engine developers** can make and publish apps like sprite/map/audio editors

* **Artists** can use these apps to make and publish game assets like spritesheets/sfx

* **Game developers** can use these apps and assets to build and publish games
