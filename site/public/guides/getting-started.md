# Getting Started

This guide sets up a dev environment for making and testing
apps in [os.90s.dev](https://os.90s.dev).


## Hello World

1. Download [helloworld.zip](${OSHOST}/helloworld.zip)

2. Extract to `helloworld` somewhere

3. Open [os.90s.dev/?app=sys/apps/filer.app.js](https://os.90s.dev/?app=sys/apps/filer.app.js)

4. Mount `helloworld/app` and click it in the sidebar

5. Click `helloworld.app.js` (it may take a second)


## Your first edit

1. Open `helloworld` in your favorite IDE

2. Change some text or something

3. Click the app again in `filer.app.js`


### Going further

The entire core and all system apps are included in [helloworld.zip](${OSHOST}/helloworld.zip), so that you can fully understand what everything does, learn from it, and experiment more easily.

You can copy any default sys app into your apps, modify them, and run those.


### Caveats

*Updated 4/22/2025*

1. All runnable files must be named `.tsx` for technical reasons, never `.ts`
