# Getting started

This guide sets up a dev environment for
apps and libraries in [90s.dev/os/](/os/)


## Hello World

To getting a "hello world" sample app working:

1. Extract [helloworld.zip](/os/helloworld.zip) to `helloworld/`

2. Open [90s.dev/os/#sys/apps/filer.app.js](/os/#sys/apps/filer.app.js)

3. Mount `helloworld/app` as `app` and click it

4. Click `helloworld.app.js` (it may take a sec)

5. Open `helloworld` in your favorite IDE

6. Change some text or something

7. Click the app again in `filer.app.js`

Congratulations, your hello world app works!

## Next steps

The entire core and all system apps are included in
the zip. This way you can see how the system works
internally, and even fork and modify built-in apps.

Check out the [Hello World guide](hello-world.md#hello-world-tour)
for a full breakdown of the sample code.
